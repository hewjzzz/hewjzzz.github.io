## About Me

Hello to whoever steps on this page :)

I am Weijia, an Assistant professor (Lecturer) in the School of ECS at the University of Southampton. I mainly work on human-centred security and privacy research, often with a focus on ubiquitous computing systems. As a believer that technology is the closest form of magic we can find in the real world, I always feel excited about how computing systems can impact the physical world and how we can utilize this magic to better support people's lives. My prior work is mainly about security and privacy research on home IoT devices, and I am looking forward to doing more in other ubiquitous computing systems (e.g., AR/VR, smart environment, etc.)

Before joining the University of Southampton, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Dartmouth College, working with Professor [David Kotz](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~kotz/) on the [SPLICE project](https://splice-project.org/). I obtained my Ph.D. degree of Computer Science at University of Chicago, advised by Professor [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/), and my B.Eng. in Cybersecurity from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2017.

<highlight>I am looking for prospective Ph.D. students to join me in 2025. I also welcome master students or undergrads who would like to get a taste of what research is like. If my research sounds like something you would love to explore more, feel free to drop me an email.</highlight>
