# [About Me](#About-Me)

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Dartmouth College, working with Professor [David Kotz](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~kotz/) on the [SPLICE project](https://splice-project.org/).
Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree of Computer Science at University of Chicago, advised by Professor [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/). I received my B.Eng. in Cybersecurity from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2017.

My main research interests relate to security and privacy issues in ubiquitous computing systems. I studied contextual access control systems in smart homes in terms of both users' mental models (USENIX Security 2018, PETS 2024) and sensing techniques (EuroS&P 2021). My recent project is around network traffic analysis for smart home devices. Outside smart homes, I am also generally interested in any IoT systems (or CPS). It is exciting to think about all the technologies that might have a physical impact in one's daily life and how we can make them more secure.
